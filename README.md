This repository contains various general-purpose helpers, such as extensions
and wrappers, to extend the Swift standard library.

This is not intended to be a single framework; rather, it is suggested to add
this repository as a git submodule and then pick individual files for inclusion
directly into the project. That being said, there are XCode targets for building
everything as a framework, mainly for testing in the included playground.

Documentation is in the comments of the individual files, and there are
examples in the playground.
